# ðŸŒ³ TreeSift

A clean, minimal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis library for JavaScript and TypeScript â€”  
built for component discovery, documentation pipelines, and design system tooling.

---

## âš¡ What is TreeSift?

TreeSift is a lightweight foundation for code analysis, designed to help understand and map your components, props, and patterns.

Right now it's simple â€” but the goal is to turn this into a flexible, extendable, and rock-solid backbone for automated component documentation, intelligent design system integration, and even visual tooling.

## ðŸ§  Designed For

TreeSift is being built to support a wide range of workflows, including:

- ðŸ“š **Documentation Generators**
- ðŸ§© **Design System Metadata Extraction**
- ðŸ”¬ **Static Code Analysis**
- âš¡ **Visual UI Builders**

While still early, the goal is to make the library smart enough to feed into anything from docs to rendering engines.
