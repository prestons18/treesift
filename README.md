# ðŸŒ³ TreeSift

A clean, minimal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis library for JavaScript and TypeScript â€”  
built for component discovery, documentation pipelines, and design system tooling.

---

## âš¡ What is TreeSift?

TreeSift is a lightweight foundation for code analysis, designed to help understand and map your components, props, and patterns.

Right now it's simple - but the goal is to turn this into a flexible, extendable, and rock-solid backbone for automated component documentation, intelligent design system integration, and even visual tooling.

## ðŸ§  Designed For

TreeSift is being built to support a wide range of workflows, including:

- ðŸ“š **Documentation Generators**
- ðŸ§© **Design System Metadata Extraction**
- ðŸ”¬ **Static Code Analysis**
- âš¡ **Visual UI Builders**

While still early, the goal is to make the library smart enough to feed into anything from docs to rendering engines.

## ðŸ’¡ Example Usage

```ts
import { TreeSift } from "treesift";

const result = TreeSift.analyze("/path/to/Component.tsx");

console.log(result);
/*
{
  name: 'MyButton',
  props: ['variant', 'size'],
  hooks: ['useState', 'useEffect'],
  cvaConfigs: ['buttonVariants'],
  classNames: {
    importSource: 'clsx',
    importName: 'cn',
    usages: [
      { line: 25, column: 10, arguments: ['font-bold', 'text-red-500'] }
    ]
  },
  stylingLibrary: {
    type: 'tailwind',
    confidence: 60,
    indicators: ['Imports from clsx', 'Imports from tailwindcss', 'Uses Tailwind-like class: text-2xl']
  },
  imports: [...],
  exports: [...],
  jsxElements: ['button', 'Icon']
}
*/
